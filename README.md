# ShopOnline

This is an ecommerce website built using Blazor WebAssembly (WASM). It was built while following a YouTube tutorial promoted by freeCodeCamp and taught by senior C# developer Gavin Lon. 

The tutorial featured a walkthrough and introduction to how Blazor WASM works with an ASP.NET Core backend and SQL Server database. It featured a PayPal JS interop payment gateway integration, but was not applied in this solution due to required research and unnecessary learning at the stage of my developer journey.
