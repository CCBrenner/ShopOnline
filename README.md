# ShopOnline

This is an ecommerce website built using Blazor WebAssembly (WASM). It was built while following a YouTube tutorial promoted by freeCodeCamp and taught by senior C# developer Gavin Lon. 

The tutorial featured a walkthrough and introduction to how Blazor WASM works with an ASP.NET Core backend and SQL Server database. It featured a PayPal JS interop payment gateway integration, but was not implemented in this repository due to required research and unnecessary learning at the current stage of my developer journey at the time.
